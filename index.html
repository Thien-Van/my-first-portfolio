            About Thien-Van
          </h3>
          <p>After graduating from college I decided to gain experience in marketing. Since I already learned how to design games, I wanted to be able to sell them. Along the way I realized that utilizing my skills as a game designer, I can make a great impact on developing apps and websites</p>
          <!-- Embedding the link straight into the text here so it doesn't disrupt the reading flow. -->
          <p>This led me to become a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> in order to master REACT and become an absolute frontend BEAST!</p>
          <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer (or are looking for a hackathon partner) please reach out! I am excited to work with other developers to build awesome software.</p>
